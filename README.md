This code automates the visual quality control of cell therapy cultures in conformance with FDA regulations—an otherwise manual and subjective process performed by expert technicians. The dataset (not included) consists of brightfield microscope images of healthy vs morphological deviated cells. It consists of a preprocessing (including contrast enhancement with CLAHE), cell segmentation (CellPose2, Pachitariu et al 2022), post processing and outlier removal. 
Segmented cell countours are then used to calculate ~30 morphometric features spanning shape, texture, and intensity. The morphological features are used to visualize data using supervised and unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods and to train an XGBoost classifier. The classifier had 100% accuracy on a small validation set (n = 10).
